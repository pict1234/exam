Wadatsumi managed to pull the Thousand Sunny underwater and put the Sun Pirates' ship in the path of the Big Mom Pirates' cannon fire, but the Big Mom Pirates quickly see through this ruse and Oven attacks Wadatsumi. With the Sunny still hours away from escaping Totto Land, and a revitalized Big Mom heading for Cacao Island at great speed, the Sun Pirates attack the forces on the Queen Mama Chanter, and Jinbe cannot bring himself to leave them. Luffy tells Jinbe to survive and reunite with them at Wano Country, proclaiming himself to be Jinbe's captain. Wit
